The code is in folder "serach"

1.The spider for "goolge.com " and "alexa.com" are under the same folder, just uncommand the code.

2. For "google.com", crawled the search result for each domain, but it was very easy to be blocked by google

3. For "alexa.com", the spider worked very well, 10 items/min. I crawled both the "global ranking" and "total link" for each domain.

4. For analyzing, the code is in ml.py.
